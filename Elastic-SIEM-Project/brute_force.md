# Brute-Force Attack Detection with Elastic SIEM: Step-by-Step Guide

This guide walks through setting up a brute-force attack simulation environment and configuring Elastic SIEM to detect these attacks. The simulation helps understand how attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access through password guessing and how a SIEM can detect and alert on such activities.

## 1. Overview

All necessary files for this exercise are already included in the repository you've downloaded. The main components we'll be working with are:

- SSH target container (ssh-target) - The target of our simulated attack
- Hydra attacker container (hydra-attacker) - Used to perform the brute-force attack
- Logstash pipeline configuration - Already configured to parse SSH authentication logs
- Filebeat configuration - Already set up to collect logs from the SSH target
- Brute-force simulation script - Ready to execute the attack simulation

## 2. Start the Additional Containers

First, ensure you've deployed the main Elastic Stack components as described in the DEPLOYMENT.md file. Then, start the additional containers needed for this simulation. They live behind the `simulation` profile, so start them with:

```bash
docker compose --profile simulation up -d ssh-target hydra-attacker
```

This will start:
- An SSH server container that will be the target of our attack
- An attacker container with Hydra installed (a password-cracking tool)

## 3. Verify Components Are Ready

```bash
docker compose ps ssh-target hydra-attacker
```

Ensure both containers show a status of "Up".

## 4. Configure Kibana Detection Rule

1. Log in to Kibana at `http://localhost:5601`
2. Navigate to **Security** > **Rules** > **Detection rules (SIEM)** > **Create new rule**

![rules navigation](./screenshots/rules_navigation.png "Navigate to rules")

3. Select **Threshold** rule type

![choose threshold](./screenshots/choose_threshold.png "Choose Threshold")

4. Define the rule:
   - **Index patterns**: Include filebeat-* patterns
   - **Custom query**: `tags:authentication_failure OR message:*Failed password* OR message:*authentication failure*`
   - **Group by field**: `host.ip.keyword`
   - **Threshold**: 3
   - **Timeframe**: 5 minutes

5. Configure rule settings:
   - **Rule name**: "Brute-Force Attack Detection"
   - **Description**: "Detects if someone is trying to brute-force into system"
   - **Risk score**: 73
   - **Severity**: High
   - **Tags**: "brute-force", "authentication", "credential-access"
   - **MITRE ATT&CK**: Select "Credential Access" and "Brute Force (T1110)"
   - **False positive examples**: Add "Users who forgot passwords and made multiple attempts"

6. Set schedule:
   - **Runs every**: 5m
   - **Additional look-back time**: 1m

7. Save and enable the rule

## 5. Run the Simulation

The brute-force attack simulation script is already included in the repository. Execute it to simulate the attack:

```bash
chmod +x simulation/run-brute-force.sh
./simulation/run-brute-force.sh
```

> Tip: once the attack has run, analyze it with the AI layer and review it in the
> supervision dashboard — see [`docs/04-uso-y-ejecucion.md`](./docs/04-uso-y-ejecucion.md):
> ```bash
> python3 siem_pipeline.py && python3 dashboard.py   # http://127.0.0.1:5000
> ```

The script will:
- Create a password list in the hydra-attacker container
- Find the IP address of the ssh-target container
- Run a brute-force attack using Hydra with multiple password attempts
- Check if logs are being generated

## 6. Check Kibana for Alerts

After running the simulation:

1. Wait approximately 5-10 minutes for the detection rule to trigger
2. In Kibana, navigate to **Security** > **Alerts**
3. You should see an alert for "Brute-Force Attack Detection"

![alert](./screenshots/alert.png)

## 7. Analyzing the Alert

The alert shows:
- Multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address
- A timeline of the attack
- The exact authentication failure events
- The source IP address that initiated the attack
- The targeted username

You can click on the alert to see more details, including:
- All source and destination IP addresses
- All authentication attempts (failures and successes)
- Timestamps for each event

### Important!
Don't forget to shutdown and delete the containers for this scenario before moving on to the next one!

```bash
docker compose --profile simulation rm -sf ssh-target hydra-attacker
```

Also if you're done with elastic SIEM you should shutdown and delete its containers:
```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Conclusion

You have successfully set up a brute-force attack simulation environment and configured Elastic SIEM to detect these attacks. This hands-on experience demonstrates how security information and event management (SIEM) systems can identify and alert on potential security threats in real-time.

The simulation helps security professionals understand:
- How brute-force attacks are executed
- How to configure detection rules for authentication failures
- How to analyze security alerts in Elastic SIEM
- The importance of log collection and processing in security monitoring

This knowledge can be applied to enhance security monitoring in production environments and develop more sophisticated detection and response strategies.
